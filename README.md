# GUI for gem5

## Dependencies
* PySide2 5.13.2
* shiboken2 5.13.2


## Installation
*Note:* This install process assumes you have already installed python**3.6** or later. Visit [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/) to download. Virtualenv can also be installed with ```pip3 install virtualenv``` (see step 2).

### Step 1
Clone our repository into the gem5 repository using:

    https://github.com/afarooqui98/gem5_GUI.git

### Step 2 (Optional)
Create a virtual environment to manage installed packages and activate it.

    virtualenv -p python venv
    source venv/bin/activate



*troubleshooting:* Machines with multiple versions of python will have multiple names for each version. If ```-p python``` doesn't work, you can replace with ```-p python[version]```. Once your virtual environment is active, type ```python --version``` to ensure that you are using python 3.6.+

### Step 3
Download dependencies using:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


## Proof of Concept
In order to run the gui:

    <gem5.opt path> gui.py

You may need to specify the gem5 root directory if the above yields import errors. On the command line:

    GEM5_HOME=<path to gem5>
